# Bird Data Analysis

An analysis of datasets to gain an insight into the movements of migratory birds.
This project utilises Python along with pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and the cartopy package.

## Gull Tracking
This project explores the migratory patterns of three Gulls from their Summer breeding grounds on the Belgian and Dutch coasts to their winter feeding grounds in North West Africa - namely Morocco, Senegal and the Gambia.

I used this data to:
* Plot the latitude and longitude of a flight trajectory for a single bird on a standard 2D plot
* Plotted the flight trajectories for each of the gulls on a 2D plot
* Plotted a histogram of speed frequencies for a single bird
* Calculated the daily mean speed for a single bird to determine which days it flew long distances on during its migration
* Plotted the daily mean speeds for each of the gulls
* Plotted a Cartographic Projection for each of the gulls
